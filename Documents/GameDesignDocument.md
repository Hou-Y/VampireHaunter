# Vampire Haunter #
You DIED. 

In retrospect going to this “Dr.Acula’s Miraculous Cure Centre” was not your brightest idea but you had a terminal illness and with only one year left, what could go wrong?

The answer is: a lot. 

Apparently Dr.Acula is a vampire and you just became his last snack. Now you’re dead. Dead as a doorknob. Or well, not exactly. You became a ghost. 

But every cloud has a silver lining: You can haunt your killer now! 

You’re NOT a vampire hunter, you are a vampire HAUNTER.

## Overview and vision statement ##
Vampire Haunter is a 2D short story driven RPG game in which you can haunt a vampire in his own mansion. 

## Gameplay ##
Player can:
- Move (WASD keys)
- Interact with objects by pushing E key which can possess such objects (moving objects and cannot cross walls, it will make the player visible and if Dr.Acula touches the player while possessing the object the possession will stop and Dr.Acula will bring the objects back to their original place)
- Scream by pushing F key which can break glasses or objects made of glass and can attract Dr.Acula to the player's location (eventually scaring Dr.Acula in specific cases)
- Cross walls if the rooms in both sides are already discovered
- Move objects in specific areas to create scary artifacts
- Jamming 

Camera: 
- Top down 2d
- Centered around the player, can zoom in or zoom out

Dr.Acula:
- Has visual cone, going inside such cone the player (if possessing an object) will be seen by Dr.Acula
- Scripted behaviour, if enough stress/fear is acquired routine will change
    1) Pathfinding for movement
